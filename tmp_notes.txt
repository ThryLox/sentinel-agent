Initial release: MVP Windows endpoint agent. SHA256(agent.exe)=886D20A88DBD9119AC9538587B37485FE239C533E4DE48BED18AB98739C34239. The Windows executable has been removed from the main branch and is available as a release asset. This release will be augmented by a workflow that auto-builds binaries & uploads checksums/signatures on tag push (.github/workflows/release.yml). To verify signed artifacts locally: import publisher public key (gpg --import publisher_pubkey.asc), then gpg --verify checksums.txt.sig checksums.txt and confirm SHA256.
\n\nCosign keyless signing added to CI: verify artifacts with 'cosign verify-blob --keyless --signature <sig> <artifact>'. See .github/workflows/release.yml for details.
